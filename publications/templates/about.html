    <p>OPTIMAP is a search platform for scientific publications based on articles with geospatial metadata, i.e. locations and time periods that are considered in a publication. OPTIMAP connects with journals, repositories, and preprint servers to put publications literally <em>on a map</em> to create new connections between research outputs across all scientific disciplines.</p>
