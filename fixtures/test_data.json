      "abstract": "Understanding the specific characteristics and vulnerabilities of city populations to heat stress is key for developing targeted adaptation strategies. This study provides high‐resolution modeling across major German cities, revealing that heat stress may cause up to a doubling of temperature‐related deaths by 2050 under current emission pathways. Proactive urban planning and public health measures are urgently needed to mitigate these projected impacts. ",

Surveys across 5,000 respondents show that Germans favor localized CDR projects—especially those minimizing environmental risks—over distant or offshore alternatives. Findings suggest policymakers must tailor communication about environmental safety to maintain public trust. ",

In this study, we quantify projected losses in German manufacturing and service sectors due to rising temperatures and extreme weather. Results indicate cumulative GDP reductions of 2–4% by 2050 if adaptation measures remain limited. These findings underline the urgent need for sector‐specific resilience planning at local and national levels.",
